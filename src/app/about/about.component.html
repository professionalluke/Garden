    <h2>The Man, the Myth, the Legend</h2>

    <p>
        Now, this is a story all about how
        My life got flipped-turned upside down
        And I'd like to take a minute
        Just sit right there
        I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
        In west Philadelphia born and raised
        On the playground was where I spent most of my days
        Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
        And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good
        Started making trouble in my neighborhood
        I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
        She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
        I begged and pleaded with her day after day
        But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way
        She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
        I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
        First class, yo this is bad
        Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
        Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
        Hmm this might be alright.
        But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
        Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
        I don't think so
        I'll see when I get there
        I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
        Well, the plane landed and when I came out
        There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
        I ain't trying to get arrested yet
        I just got here
        I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
        I whistled for a cab and when it came near
        The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
        If anything I could say that this cab was rare
        But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
        I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
        And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
        I looked at my kingdom
        I was finally there
        To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
